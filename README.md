# Privilege and Survival: A Descriptive Analysis of the Titanic Disaster

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic passenger manifest to understand the factors that led to survival, with a focus on socioeconomic privileges.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* **Excel:** Main analysis tool.
* **Power Query:** Used for data cleaning and ETL processes.
* **Pivot Tables:** For data summarization.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning (ETL)
The dataset underwent a cleaning process where:
* Missing values for 'Age' were addressed.
* Unnecessary columns for this specific analysis were removed.
* Data types were standardized.

## 📊 Key Findings
* **Class Privilege:** 1st class passengers had the highest survival rate.
* **Gender & Age:** The "women and children first" rule was evident, but social class still created disparities within these groups.
