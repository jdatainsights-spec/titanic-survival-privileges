# Privilege and Survival: A Descriptive Analysis of the Titanic Disaster

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic passenger manifest to understand the factors that led to survival, with a focus on socioeconomic privileges.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* **Excel:** Main analysis tool.
* **Power Query:** Used for data cleaning and ETL processes.
* **Pivot Tables:** For data summarization.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning (ETL)
The dataset underwent a cleaning process where:
* Missing values for 'Age' were addressed.
* Unnecessary columns for this specific analysis were removed.
* Data types were standardized.

## 📊 Key Findings

Based on the descriptive analysis of the 891 passengers in the dataset, the following insights were identified:

### 1. The Survival Hierarchy: Gender & Class
The data confirms that while the overall survival rate was **38.38%**, survival was heavily dictated by a combination of gender and social class. Women across all classes had a significantly higher probability of surviving than men. However, the "Class Gap" remains undeniable: a **First-Class** passenger was nearly **twice as likely to survive** as a **Third-Class** passenger.

### 2. The Critical Point: Vulnerability of Third-Class Men
The most striking finding is the extreme vulnerability of men in the lower socioeconomic bracket. **33.67% of the total passenger manifest** consisted of Third-Class men who did not survive. This group represents the single greatest human loss of the shipwreck, highlighting how the lack of privilege combined with gender expectations resulted in a tragic outcome.

### 3. Mortality Concentration
When analyzing the "Not Survived" group (which accounts for **61.62%** of the total passengers), the disparity is stark:
* **85.25%** of those who perished were men.
* Only **14.75%** were women. 

This reinforces that gender was the strongest determining factor for survival, although socioeconomic status significantly influenced the odds within each group.
